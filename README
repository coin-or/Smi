Smi - Stochastic Modeling Interface

To install this package, please look at the INSTALL file.

This package contains several subdirectories corresponding to COIN-OR
projects (www.coin-or.org). The AUTHORS, LICENSE and README files in 
each of the subdirectories give more information about these projects.


The examples directory contains a few use cases.

* stoch.cpp is the main repository of use cases -- it contains several
  distinct examples of input styles.

* investment.cpp is a use case using FlopC++.  This is under active development
  but is stable enough to be included in trunk

Active development is proceeding on the SmiBenders branch.
